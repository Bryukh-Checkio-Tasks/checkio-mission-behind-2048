    <i>You are given a 4x4 matrix expressed in a 2D list, the task is to give the game its basic movements.
    The matrix should be able to move in all 4 directions. For the conveneince of checking (sorry...), the rule of random element generation is defined.
    The new element is always the number 2, and should always appear on the last zero-element index.

</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> a 2D list of the 2048 matrix and a string as the option for type of movement, i.e., 'up', 'down', 'left' or 'right'
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong>the result 2d list 2048 matrix, new element should alway be 2 and appear on the last zero-element index.
    Indexes in a matrix looks lke this => [[0,1,2,3],[4,5,6,7],[8,9,10,11],[12,13,14,15]]
      the last index is  15. If the element at index 15 is non-zero, then the last index should the largest index that has a zero-element.
