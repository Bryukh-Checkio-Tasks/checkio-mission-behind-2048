<p><i>You are given a 4x4 matrix expressed as a 2D list. YOUR task is to give the game its basic movement functionality. The matrix should allow for movement in all 4 directions (Up, Down, Left, Right). For convenience, the random element generation rule is defined as followed. The new element will always be 2 and should always appear on the last zero-element index. <br><strong>Notice:</strong><br>(a)If there's no room for the movement (as in example 3 and 4 below), new number will not be generated. <br>(b)At the brginning of 2048, there's already two numbers in matrix. An all-zero matrix is not possible. <br>(b)One movement can only have on 'add' action for each number(as in example 2 below).<br>(c)If the game is won ,i.e. whenever a 1024 is added to another 1024. The rutern winning message is a 2D list [['U','W','I','N'], ['U','W','I','N'], ['U','W','I','N'], ['U','W','I','N']], as in example 5.</i></p>

<p>More information about this game can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_%28video_game%29">here</a> </p>

<p><strong>Input: </strong> A 2D list of the 2048 matrix and a string as the option for type of movement, i.e., 'up', 'down', 'left' or 'right' </p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>The result 2d list 2048 matrix, new element should alway be 2 and appear on the last zero-element index. Indexes in a matrix looks lke this => [[0,1,2,3],[4,5,6,7],[8,9,10,11],[12,13,14,15]] the last index is  15. If the element at index 15 is non-zero, then the last index should the largest index that has a zero-element. </p>

<p><strong>Preconditions: </strong> (a)The matrix is always 4*4. (b)The numebers in the matrix are always 0 or 2**n, for all n is positive integer 1~10.</p>

<p class="for_info_only"><strong>How it is used:</strong>
This can be used as a bases for further adding GUI to the python verison of the 2048 game.
